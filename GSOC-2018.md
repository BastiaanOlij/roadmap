# Google Summer of Code 2018

This is a list of project ideas for students applying to the Gooogle Summer
of Code program.

## TSCN exporter for Blender

The 3D workflow is currently done by exporting the models from Blender
in an interchange format (such as Collada or glTF) and them import into
Godot. However, this can lead to a few inconsistencies due to the
peculiarities of exporter and importer plugins.

One idea would be to create an export plugin for Blender that already
save the model in the Godot's specific scene format.

This would require understanding the Blender API and the text format
of Godot scenes.

## ARCore support and CameraServer improvements

Augmented Reality is a new trend in game and application development.
This project is about creating an interface to support the ARCore library
and improving the progress in the CameraServer proposal.

## GearVR and Daydream support

Another modern topic is virtual reality. The participants of this project
would work on support two SDKs for mobile VR: GearVR and Daydream. This would
be based on the Godot's VR backend, which is already availabled.

## Oculus Rift support

Also for Virtual Reality, but this time for desktop. Oculus Rift is one of
the pioneers of VR headsets and adding support for it would certainly be
and advantage for Godot.

## Microphone API and audio input

There is a few genres of games that relies on audio input from the player,
especially through the device's microphone.

This project is about supporting such input in the many platforms that Godot
supports, both desktop and mobile.

## WebRTC integration

WebRTC is a project that enables real time communication inside the browser
with ease. Adding support for it on Godot would allow game developers to
make multiplayer games on mobile and on the browser without issues.

## Improve i18n support

Godot currenlty uses CSV files for game translations but this format is not widely supported by the translation engines.

This project would consist in providing support for `gettext` features (
`.po ` and `.mo` files), which is more capable and easier to make translations
using specialized third-party software.

## Itertools library for GDScript

Python's itertools is a powerfull library to deal with iterators and
combinatorics.

This project consists in making most or all of those functions available
for GDScript code, to be readily used in game projects.

## GDScript Code formatter

The integrated script editor of Godot is a great tool for editing GDScript
files, with code folding and auto-completion. However, there's nothing yet
to make the code look pretty to the human eyes.

Following this idea, the applicant would work on a set of editor features
to define code beautifier rules and apply them automatically to the source
code.

## Plugins for video decoding

It's quite common for games to rely on videos for intros and cutscenes. However, supporting all the myriad of formats out-of-the-box is unpractical
for Godot's unbloated and open source approach.

The idea is to have multiple official plugins that can be added to each
game individually using the GDNative interface, allowing many more video
codecs to be supported than what's currently available.


## Plugins for MIDI and MOD support

MIDI and MOD are small audio formats that are based on events and musical
information, rather than storing the digitalization of a sound.

Supporting this would require the ability for users to set sample libraries
and loading the files in editor as resources (by using the import system).

## Template builder for Android and iOS

It's common for mobile applications to load extra modules, in particular for
ad support (which is a common request). Since Godot won't pick a specific
ad provider, all the modules comes from third-party.

To ease the job of users relying on those modules, the template builder would
allow game developers to bundle modules in the export process.

## Headless version for server applications

Sometimes Godot need to run in a server environment, be it to act as a
server for a game, or to be used in a Continuous Integration environment.

The headless version would have no requirement for sound cards nor graphical
capabilities, since those are not available on servers. This would require a
dummy graphics and audio drivers for Godot.
